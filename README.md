# üè• Hospital Emergency Room Scraper

Real-time monitoring of emergency room wait times for Vivantes Friedrichshain Hospital (Adult & Children departments).

## Features

- **Dual Department Monitoring**: Scrapes both Adult and Children emergency rooms sequentially
- **Department Classification**: Data tagged with department (`adult` or `children`)
- **Automated Scheduling**: Runs every 30 minutes via cron
- **Elasticsearch Storage**: Time-series data with full observability
- **Robust Error Handling**: Automatic retries and comprehensive logging

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Elasticsearch credentials

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build and start
npm run build
npm start
```

## Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
# Elasticsearch Cloud
ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_URL=https://your-deployment.es.region.cloud.es.io:9200
ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Optional - URLs to scrape
ADULT_TARGET_URL=https://www.vivantes.de/klinikum-im-friedrichshain/rettungsstelle
CHILDREN_TARGET_URL=https://www.vivantes.de/klinikum-im-friedrichshain/kinder-jugendmedizin/kinderrettungsstelle
```

## üöÄ Deployment

I have provided easy deployment options using popular container orchestration tools:

### Container Management Platforms

- **[Dockge](./dockge/README.md)** - Recommended for Proxmox environments
  - UI-only deployment workflow
  - Visual monitoring and log management
  - One-click updates and container management
  - Perfect for self-hosted setups

- **[Portainer](./portainer/README.md)** - Universal Docker management
  - Web-based Docker management
  - Stack deployment with environment variables
  - Real-time monitoring and log streaming
  - Works on any Docker host

Both options include:
- ‚úÖ Complete docker-compose configurations
- ‚úÖ Environment variable templates
- ‚úÖ Health checks and monitoring setup
- ‚úÖ Persistent data volumes
- ‚úÖ OpenTelemetry observability stack

Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Scripts

- **`scripts/cleanup-elasticsearch.js`** - Cleans up Elasticsearch index, template, and ILM policy for fresh testing

## Data Schema

Each scraping run produces records with:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `department` | `string` | `"adult"` or `"children"` |
| `waitTimeMinutes` | `number` | Current wait time |
| `totalPatients` | `number` | Patients in treatment/waiting |
| `ambulancePatients` | `number` | Patients arrived by ambulance |
| `emergencyCases` | `number` | Life-threatening cases |
| `updateDelayMinutes` | `number` | Data freshness (minutes since last update) |
| `timestamp` | `Date` | When data was scraped |
| `sourceUrl` | `string` | Source hospital URL |

**Core Components:**
- **Job Runner**: Orchestrates sequential scraping of both URLs
- **Playwright Scraper**: Browser-based data extraction
- **Data Extractor**: DOM parsing and data validation
- **Database Client**: Elasticsearch storage with observability
- **Retry Handler**: Error recovery and resilience

## Development

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## Monitoring

- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- **Logs**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: OpenTelemetry metrics exported to Elasticsearch APM
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing for debugging
