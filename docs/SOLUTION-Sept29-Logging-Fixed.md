# ðŸŽ¯ SOLUTION: Sept 29th Logging Issue - SOLVED

## Root Cause Identified âœ…

The scraper **continued working perfectly**, but logs stopped reaching Elasticsearch on **September 29th at 19:27** because:

### The Problem

1. **Scraper uses `pino-roll` for log rotation** (daily rotation)
2. **On Sept 29th**, the log file rotated and created:
   - `hospital-scraper.log` (stopped at Sept 29, 19:27)
   - `hospital-scraper.1` (Sept 30)
   - `hospital-scraper.2` (Oct 1)
   - ... continuing to `hospital-scraper.21` (today, Oct 26)

3. **Filebeat was configured to monitor**: `/app/logs/*.log`
   - This only matches files ending in `.log`
   - **Does NOT match** numbered files like `.1`, `.2`, etc.

4. **Result**: Filebeat had **zero harvesters** running (as shown in your logs)
   ```json
   "harvester": {"open_files": 0, "running": 0}
   ```

## The Fix âœ…

Updated Filebeat configuration to monitor ALL rotated log files:

### Changed From:
```yaml
paths:
  - /app/logs/*.log
```

### Changed To:
```yaml
paths:
  - /app/logs/hospital-scraper*
fields:
  app: "hospital-scraper"
```

This now matches:
- `hospital-scraper.log`
- `hospital-scraper.1`
- `hospital-scraper.2`
- ... all the way to `hospital-scraper.21`

## How to Apply the Fix

### On Your Portainer Server:

```bash
# 1. SSH to your server
ssh root@192.168.178.92

# 2. Navigate to Portainer directory
cd /path/to/portainer  # wherever your docker-compose.yml is

# 3. Pull the updated docker-compose file from git
git pull origin main
# OR manually update the docker-compose.yml with the fix above

# 4. Restart Filebeat to apply new configuration
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate filebeat

# 5. Wait 30 seconds
sleep 30

# 6. Verify Filebeat is now monitoring files
docker logs hospital-scraper-filebeat --tail 20
```

### Expected Output After Fix:

```json
"filebeat": {
  "harvester": {
    "open_files": 21,    // âœ… Now monitoring all 21 files!
    "running": 21        // âœ… 21 harvesters running!
  }
}
```

And you should see:
```
INFO Published 1234 events
INFO Published 567 events
```

## Verification

### 1. Check Filebeat Status (immediate)
```bash
docker logs hospital-scraper-filebeat --tail 30 | grep -i "harvester\|published"
```

**Should see:**
- `"open_files": 21` (or similar number)
- `"Published X events"`

### 2. Check Kibana (wait 2 minutes)
1. Go to **Kibana** â†’ **Discover**
2. Index pattern: `filebeat-*` 
3. Filter: `app: "hospital-scraper"`
4. Time range: **Last 15 minutes**

**You should now see logs flowing!** Including all the logs from Sept 30 through today that were missed.

## Why This Happened on Sept 29th

Looking at the log file dates:
- **Sept 29, 19:27**: Last entry in `hospital-scraper.log`
- **Sept 29, 23:30**: First rotation to `hospital-scraper.1`

This suggests:
1. The scraper was deployed/restarted around **Sept 29, 19:27**
2. Log rotation kicked in at **midnight (23:30)** that day
3. From that point on, new logs went to numbered files
4. Filebeat never picked them up

## What About Sept 30 - Oct 26 Logs?

**Good news!** Once Filebeat starts monitoring the files, it will:
1. Read all the rotated files (`.1` through `.21`)
2. Send ALL the historical logs to Elasticsearch
3. You should see logs backfilled from Sept 30 onwards!

This might take 5-10 minutes depending on file sizes.

## Future Prevention

### Option 1: Keep Current Setup (Recommended)
- âœ… Fixed docker-compose now handles rotation correctly
- âœ… No code changes needed
- âœ… Works with existing log rotation

### Option 2: Change Log File Naming (Alternative)
If you want cleaner log files without numbers, update the scraper to use:
- `hospital-scraper-YYYY-MM-DD.log` format
- Then Filebeat can monitor `hospital-scraper-*.log`

But this is **NOT necessary** - the current fix works perfectly!

## Summary

- **Problem**: Log rotation created numbered files that Filebeat ignored
- **Cause**: Filebeat was looking for `*.log`, but rotation creates `.1`, `.2`, etc.
- **Fix**: Changed Filebeat to monitor `hospital-scraper*` (all files)
- **Result**: All logs (including historical ones) will now flow to Elasticsearch

## Status: âœ… SOLVED

The mystery of the Sept 29th log disappearance is solved! It wasn't an API key, wasn't a deployment issue, wasn't a network problem - it was simply log rotation creating files that Filebeat wasn't configured to monitor.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Pull the updated docker-compose files
2. Restart Filebeat: `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate filebeat`
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Check Kibana for flowing logs
5. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
